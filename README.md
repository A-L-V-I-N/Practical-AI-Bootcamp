# Practical AI Bootcamp

Practical AI Bootcamp by [TinkerHub Foundation](https://tinkerhub.org). Here you will learn how to build AI products. This learning program cover the following.

1. Finding the right machine learning model for a problem
2. Building responsible AI - Bias and other issues
3. How to train a good machine learning model - how to tune hyperparams
4. Transfer Learning - where, when and how to use ?
5. Speed and performance
6. Wraping and hosting machine learning models
7. On device machine learning

## Participants criteria

- Should know OOP and python
- Should know git and github
- Should know basic machine learning (different categories of ML, what is training ? What is testing ? What is dataset..etc)
- All the resources to get you started with the program is given in the [resources folder]()https://github.com/tinkerhub-org/Practical-AI-Bootcamp/tree/main/Resources. You can learn it and finish the task for joining the program!

## Join the program

This bootcamp need you to have the following skills
